# Transfer Tactic Port Status

## Summary

I've started porting the transfer tactic from Lean 3 to Lean 4. This is a complex meta-programming task that requires significant changes due to the different tactic infrastructure in Lean 4.

## Files Created

1. **`/Users/alokbeniwal/tmp/mathlib4/Mathlib/Tactic/Nonstandard/TransferTactic.lean`**
   - Main implementation file with full structure
   - Contains all the tactic steps: lift_lhs, congr, push_lift, induction, close
   - Has proper error handling and step-by-step execution
   - Currently depends on complement files that need imports fixed

2. **`/Users/alokbeniwal/tmp/mathlib4/Mathlib/Tactic/Nonstandard/TransferTacticSimple.lean`**
   - Simplified version for testing basic functionality
   - Focuses on the forall case with proper instance synthesis

3. **`/Users/alokbeniwal/tmp/mathlib4/Mathlib/Tactic/Nonstandard/TransferBasic.lean`**
   - Very basic version exploring the theorem structure needed
   - Contains a custom theorem `forall_iff_forall_germ_liftPred`

## Key Differences from Lean 3

1. **Tactic Infrastructure**:
   - Lean 3 `meta def` → Lean 4 `elab` with tactic syntax
   - Different expression pattern matching API
   - New monad structure (TacticM, MetaM)
   - Different ways to apply theorems and manage goals

2. **Expression Structure**:
   - Pattern matching on expressions is different
   - Need to use `whnf` (weak head normal form) more explicitly
   - Type class instance synthesis is different

3. **Goal Management**:
   - `replaceMainGoal` instead of direct manipulation
   - Different API for introducing variables and managing contexts

## Current Issues

1. **Import Paths**: The complement files have incorrect imports that need fixing:
   - `Mathlib.Order.Filter.Germ` → `Mathlib.Order.Filter.Germ.Basic`

2. **Missing Theorems**: Many transfer theorems from the Lean 3 version don't exist in mathlib4:
   - Need to port theorems like `forall_iff_forall_lift_pred`
   - Need ultrafilter-specific versions of the theorems

3. **Complex Pattern Matching**: The push_lift step requires complex pattern matching on lambda expressions that needs refinement

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Imports**: Update all import paths in the complement files
2. **Port Missing Theorems**: Create the necessary transfer theorems in the complement files
3. **Test Infrastructure**: Set up proper testing with the LSP
4. **Incremental Development**: 
   - Start with just the forall case
   - Add exists case
   - Add logical connectives (and, or, not, imp)
   - Add relations (eq, ne, lt, gt)
   - Finally add the induction principle

## Testing

The tactic can be tested with examples like:

```lean
example (α ι : Type*) [Preorder α] (l : Ultrafilter ι) (a : α) : 
  (∀ x, a ≤ x) ↔ (∀ x : (l : Filter ι).Germ α, ↑a ≤ x) := by
  transfer
```

## Recommendations

1. Focus on getting one simple case working end-to-end first
2. Build up the complement files with the necessary theorems
3. Use the LSP to get real-time feedback on compilation errors
4. Consider creating a test suite with the examples from the original file
