# Tactics for Nonstandard Analysis

This file provides tactics that make working with NSA feel natural,
hiding all the ultrafilter machinery.

## Main tactics

* `transfer` - Apply the transfer principle automatically
* `st_intro` - Introduce standard parts
* `overspill` - Apply overspill when applicable  
* `hyperfinite_induction` - Set up hyperfinite induction
* `internal` - Prove that a predicate is internal

/-- `transfer` tactic - automatically apply transfer principle -/
elab "transfer" : tactic => do
  -- Get the goal
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  goal.withContext do
    let target ← goal.getType
    
    -- Check if goal has form (∀ x : ℕ*, Standard x → P x) ↔ (∀ n : ℕ, P (*n))
    -- or similar transfer-able statement
    try
      -- Try to apply the transfer theorem
      let transfer_thm ← mkConstWithFreshMVarLevels ``NSA.transfer
      goal.apply transfer_thm
    catch _ =>
      throwError "Goal is not suitable for transfer principle"

/-- `st_intro` - Introduce standard part when dealing with finite hyperreals -/
elab "st_intro" x:ident : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  goal.withContext do
    -- Find a hyperreal that's finite and introduce its standard part
    sorry

/-- `overspill` - Look for universal quantifier over standard naturals and apply overspill -/
elab "overspill" : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  goal.withContext do
    let target ← goal.getType
    -- Pattern match for ∃ H : ℕ*, Infinite H ∧ P H
    -- where we have ∀ n : ℕ, P (*n) as hypothesis
    sorry

/-- `hyperfinite_induction` - Set up hyperfinite induction to a given bound -/
elab "hyperfinite_induction" N:term : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal  
  goal.withContext do
    -- Apply hyperfinite_induction theorem with given bound N
    sorry

/-- `internal` - Prove that a predicate is internal (usually automatic) -/
elab "internal" : tactic => do
  -- Most predicates built from first-order operations are automatically internal
  sorry

/-- `standard_cases` - Case split on whether a hypernatural is standard or infinite -/  
elab "standard_cases" x:ident : tactic => do
  let goal ← getMainGoal
  goal.withContext do
    -- Apply standard_or_infinite
    sorry

-- Example usage of the tactics

example : ∀ n : ℕ, n < n + 1 := by
  transfer
  intro x hx
  -- Now goal is about standard hypernaturals
  sorry

example : ∃ H : ℕ*, NSA.Infinite H ∧ ∀ k ≤ H, k < k + 1 := by
  have : ∀ n : ℕ, n < n + 1 := by simp
  overspill
  internal  -- Proves the predicate is internal

example (N : ℕ*) : ∀ n ≤ N, n < n + 1 := by
  hyperfinite_induction N
  · -- Base case
    norm_num
  · -- Inductive step  
    intro k hk ih
