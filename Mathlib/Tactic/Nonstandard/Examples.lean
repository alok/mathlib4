# Examples of Nonstandard Analysis

This file shows how clean and intuitive NSA proofs can be when
the ultrafilter machinery is hidden.

## Key principles demonstrated

1. Every real number is surrounded by a "cloud" of hyperreals
2. We can use infinite and infinitesimal numbers naturally  
3. Continuous functions preserve nearness (≈)
4. Hyperfinite sets behave like finite sets

-- Introduce nice notation
notation x " ≈ " y => st x = st y  -- x is infinitely close to y
notation "ε" => (1 : ℝ*) / ω       -- A positive infinitesimal
notation "∞" => ω                   -- Infinity

    · simp
      -- Need to show *r * ω > 1
      -- Since ω > 1/r (as ω is infinite), we get *r * ω > *r * (1/r) = 1
      have : ω > *(Nat.ceil (1/r)) := omega_infinite _
      have : *r * ω > *r * *(Nat.ceil (1/r)) := by
        apply mul_lt_mul_of_pos_left this
        simp; exact hr
      sorry -- Complete the arithmetic
    · -- ω > 0 was shown above
      have : (0 : ℕ*) < ω := omega_infinite 0
      simp at this
      exact this

/-- The hyperreals properly extend the reals -/
example : ∃ x : ℝ*, ∀ r : ℝ, x ≠ *r := by
  use ε
  intro r
  -- If ε = *r, then ε would be standard
  -- But ε is infinitesimal, so smaller than any positive standard real
  by_cases hr : r ≤ 0
  · -- If r ≤ 0, then ε > 0 > r so ε ≠ *r
    intro h
    have : ε > 0 := by
      unfold ε
      apply div_pos one_pos

    have : ε < *r := by
      unfold ε
      sorry -- Use that ε is infinitesimal
    rw [h] at this

/* ## Continuity via infinitesimals */

/-- A function is continuous iff it preserves infinite closeness -/
theorem continuous_iff_preserves_nearness {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a : ℝ} :
    ContinuousAt f a ↔ ∀ x : ℝ*, x ≈ *a → *f(st x) ≈ *f(a) := by
  sorry

/-- Example: x² is continuous -/
example : Continuous (fun x : ℝ => x^2) := by
  intro a
  rw [continuous_iff_preserves_nearness]
  intro x hx
  -- If x ≈ *a, then x² ≈ (*a)² = *(a²)
  -- x = *a + ε for some infinitesimal ε
  -- x² = (*a)² + 2*a*ε + ε²
  -- Both 2*a*ε and ε² are infinitesimal
  sorry -- This requires showing that products preserve infinitesimals

/* ## Differentiation via infinitesimals */

/-- The derivative as a standard part -/
def derivative (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  st (((*f)(*a + ε) - (*f)(*a)) / ε)

/-- Example: derivative of x² is 2x -/
example (a : ℝ) : derivative (fun x => x^2) a = 2 * a := by
  unfold derivative
  -- Compute: ((a + ε)² - a²) / ε = (2aε + ε²) / ε = 2a + ε ≈ 2a

/* ## Integration via hyperfinite sums */

  st (hsum (hyperfinite_interval ω) (fun i => *f(a + i * (b - a) / ω) * (b - a) / ω))

/-- Example: ∫₀¹ x dx = 1/2 -/
example : integral (fun x => x) 0 1 = 1/2 := by
  unfold integral
  -- The hyperfinite sum is Σᵢ₌₀^ω (i/ω) * (1/ω) = (1/ω²) * Σᵢ₌₀^ω i
  -- = (1/ω²) * (ω(ω+1)/2) ≈ 1/2
  sorry

/* ## Sequences and limits */

/-- A sequence converges to L iff sₙ ≈ L for all infinite n -/
theorem converges_iff_infinite_close {s : ℕ → ℝ} {L : ℝ} :
    Filter.Tendsto s Filter.atTop (nhds L) ↔ 
    ∀ n : ℕ*, Infinite n → (*s) n ≈ *L := by
  sorry

/-- Example: 1/n → 0 -/
example : Filter.Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℝ) / n) Filter.atTop (nhds 0) := by
  rw [converges_iff_infinite_close]
  intro n hn
  -- For infinite n, we have 1/n ≈ 0
  -- i.e., 1/n is infinitesimal
  unfold InfinitelyClose Infinitesimal
  simp
  intro r hr
  -- Need to show |1/n| < *r
  -- Since n is infinite, n > *(ceil(1/r))
  -- So 1/n < 1/(*(ceil(1/r))) ≤ *r
  sorry -- Complete using properties of infinite hypernaturals

/* ## Compactness via hyperfinite covers */

/-- [0,1] is compact: every hyperfinite open cover has a finite subcover -/
example : IsCompact (Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) := by
  -- Suppose we have a hyperfinite collection of open sets covering [0,1]
  -- By hyperfinite induction, we can extract a finite subcover
  sorry

/* ## The Peano axioms with hyperfinite induction */

/-- ℕ* satisfies a strong form of Peano axioms -/
example : 
    (∀ P : ℕ* → Prop, Internal ℕ* P → P 0 → (∀ n, P n → P (n + 1)) → ∀ n, P n) ∧
    (∀ n : ℕ*, n ≠ 0 → ∃ m : ℕ*, n = m + 1) ∧
    (∀ m n : ℕ*, m + 1 = n + 1 → m = n) := by
  sorry

/-- But we can do even better - induction up to any hypernatural! -/
example (N : ℕ*) (P : ℕ* → Prop) [Internal ℕ* P] :
    P 0 → (∀ n < N, P n → P (n + 1)) → ∀ n ≤ N, P n := by
  exact Hypernat.hyperfinite_induction N

/* ## Nonstandard characterization of uniform continuity */

/-- f is uniformly continuous on [a,b] iff for all x,y ∈ [a,b]*, x ≈ y → f(x) ≈ f(y) -/
theorem uniform_continuous_iff {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ} :
    UniformContinuousOn f (Set.Icc a b) ↔
    ∀ x y : ℝ*, x ∈ Set.Icc (*a) (*b) → y ∈ Set.Icc (*a) (*b) → x ≈ y → (*f)(st x) ≈ (*f)(st y) := by

  -- Step 3: Let a = st((*s)(H))
  -- Step 4: Build subsequence by picking nₖ such that |s(nₖ) - a| < 1/k
  sorry

/* ## The magic: Infinite objects behave finitely */

/-- We can find the minimum of a hyperfinite set! -/
example (S : Hyperfinite ℝ*) (hS : NSA.Hyperfinite.nonempty S) :
    ∃ m ∈ S, ∀ x ∈ S, m ≤ x := by
  -- This works by hyperfinite induction, even though S might have ω elements!
  sorry

  -- Again by hyperfinite induction
  sorry

/-- The pigeonhole principle works for hyperfinite sets -/
