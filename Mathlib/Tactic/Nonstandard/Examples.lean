# Examples of Nonstandard Analysis

This file shows how clean and intuitive NSA proofs can be when
the ultrafilter machinery is hidden.

## Key principles demonstrated

1. Every real number is surrounded by a "cloud" of hyperreals
2. We can use infinite and infinitesimal numbers naturally  
3. Continuous functions preserve nearness (≈)
4. Hyperfinite sets behave like finite sets

-- Introduce nice notation
notation x " ≈ " y => st x = st y  -- x is infinitely close to y
notation "ε" => (1 : ℝ*) / ω       -- A positive infinitesimal
notation "∞" => ω                   -- Infinity

/-! ## Basic properties of hyperreals -/

/-- Infinitesimals exist! -/
example : ε > 0 ∧ ∀ r : ℝ, r > 0 → ε < *r := by
  constructor
  · -- ε > 0
    sorry
  · -- ε is smaller than every positive real
    intro r hr
    sorry

/-- The hyperreals properly extend the reals -/
example : ∃ x : ℝ*, ∀ r : ℝ, x ≠ *r := by
  use ε
  intro r
  sorry

/-! ## Continuity via infinitesimals -/

/-- A function is continuous iff it preserves infinite closeness -/
theorem continuous_iff_preserves_nearness {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a : ℝ} :
    ContinuousAt f a ↔ ∀ x : ℝ*, x ≈ *a → *f(st x) ≈ *f(a) := by
  sorry

/-- Example: x² is continuous -/
example : Continuous (fun x : ℝ => x^2) := by
  intro a
  rw [continuous_iff_preserves_nearness]
  intro x hx
  -- If x ≈ a, then x² ≈ a²
  sorry

/-! ## Differentiation via infinitesimals -/

/-- The derivative as a standard part -/
def derivative (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  st (((*f)(*a + ε) - (*f)(*a)) / ε)

/-- Example: derivative of x² is 2x -/
example (a : ℝ) : derivative (fun x => x^2) a = 2 * a := by
  unfold derivative
  -- Compute: ((a + ε)² - a²) / ε = (2aε + ε²) / ε = 2a + ε ≈ 2a
  sorry

/-! ## Integration via hyperfinite sums -/

/-- The integral as a hyperfinite Riemann sum -/
def integral (f : ℝ → ℝ) (a b : ℝ) : ℝ :=
  st (hsum (hyperfinite_interval ω) (fun i => *f(a + i * (b - a) / ω) * (b - a) / ω))

/-- Example: ∫₀¹ x dx = 1/2 -/
example : integral (fun x => x) 0 1 = 1/2 := by
  unfold integral
  -- The hyperfinite sum is Σᵢ₌₀^ω (i/ω) * (1/ω) = (1/ω²) * Σᵢ₌₀^ω i
  -- = (1/ω²) * (ω(ω+1)/2) ≈ 1/2
  sorry

/-! ## Sequences and limits -/

/-- A sequence converges to L iff sₙ ≈ L for all infinite n -/
theorem converges_iff_infinite_close {s : ℕ → ℝ} {L : ℝ} :
    Filter.Tendsto s Filter.atTop (nhds L) ↔ 
    ∀ n : ℕ*, Infinite n → (*s) n ≈ *L := by
  sorry

/-- Example: 1/n → 0 -/
example : Filter.Tendsto (fun n : ℕ => (1 : ℝ) / n) Filter.atTop (nhds 0) := by
  rw [converges_iff_infinite_close]
  intro n hn
  -- For infinite n, we have 1/n ≈ 0
  sorry

/-! ## Compactness via hyperfinite covers -/

/-- [0,1] is compact: every hyperfinite open cover has a finite subcover -/
example : IsCompact (Set.Icc (0 : ℝ) 1) := by
  -- Suppose we have a hyperfinite collection of open sets covering [0,1]
  -- By hyperfinite induction, we can extract a finite subcover
  sorry

/-! ## The Peano axioms with hyperfinite induction -/

/-- ℕ* satisfies a strong form of Peano axioms -/
example : 
    (∀ P : ℕ* → Prop, Internal ℕ* P → P 0 → (∀ n, P n → P (n + 1)) → ∀ n, P n) ∧
    (∀ n : ℕ*, n ≠ 0 → ∃ m : ℕ*, n = m + 1) ∧
    (∀ m n : ℕ*, m + 1 = n + 1 → m = n) := by
  sorry

/-- But we can do even better - induction up to any hypernatural! -/
example (N : ℕ*) (P : ℕ* → Prop) [Internal ℕ* P] :
    P 0 → (∀ n < N, P n → P (n + 1)) → ∀ n ≤ N, P n := by
  exact Hypernat.hyperfinite_induction N

/-! ## Nonstandard characterization of uniform continuity -/

/-- f is uniformly continuous on [a,b] iff for all x,y ∈ [a,b]*, x ≈ y → f(x) ≈ f(y) -/
theorem uniform_continuous_iff {f : ℝ → ℝ} {a b : ℝ} :
    UniformContinuousOn f (Set.Icc a b) ↔
    ∀ x y : ℝ*, x ∈ Set.Icc (*a) (*b) → y ∈ Set.Icc (*a) (*b) → x ≈ y → (*f)(st x) ≈ (*f)(st y) := by
  sorry

/-! ## Advanced example: Proving the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem -/

theorem bolzano_weierstrass_clean {s : ℕ → ℝ} (hs : Bornology.IsBounded (Set.range s)) :
    ∃ (a : ℝ) (φ : ℕ → ℕ), StrictMono φ ∧ Filter.Tendsto (s ∘ φ) Filter.atTop (nhds a) := by
  -- Step 1: Extend s to *s : ℕ* → ℝ*
  -- Step 2: For any infinite H, the value (*s)(H) is finite (by boundedness)
  -- Step 3: Let a = st((*s)(H))
  -- Step 4: Build subsequence by picking nₖ such that |s(nₖ) - a| < 1/k
  sorry

/-! ## The magic: Infinite objects behave finitely -/

/-- We can find the minimum of a hyperfinite set! -/
example (S : Hyperfinite ℝ*) (hS : NSA.Hyperfinite.nonempty S) :
    ∃ m ∈ S, ∀ x ∈ S, m ≤ x := by
  -- This works by hyperfinite induction, even though S might have ω elements!
  sorry

/-- Every hyperfinite set of hypernaturals has a maximum -/
example (S : Hyperfinite ℕ*) (hS : NSA.Hyperfinite.nonempty S) :
    ∃ m ∈ S, ∀ x ∈ S, x ≤ m := by
  -- Again by hyperfinite induction
  sorry

/-- The pigeonhole principle works for hyperfinite sets -/
example (S : Hyperfinite ℕ*) (T : Hyperfinite ℕ*) (f : ℕ* → ℕ*)
    (hf : ∀ x ∈ S, f x ∈ T)
    (hcard : Hyperfinite.card S > Hyperfinite.card T) :
    ∃ x y, x ∈ S ∧ y ∈ S ∧ x ≠ y ∧ f x = f y := by
  sorry
