# Hyperfinite Induction in Nonstandard Analysis

This file develops the principle of hyperfinite induction using the clean NSA interface,
without explicit reference to ultrafilters or germs.

## Main results

* `bounded_implies_standard` : If n ≤ m for standard m, then n is standard
* `hyperfinite_induction` : Induction works up to any hypernatural bound  
* `overspill` : If P holds for all standard naturals, it holds for some infinite one
* `hyperfinite_downward_induction` : We can count down from any hypernatural
