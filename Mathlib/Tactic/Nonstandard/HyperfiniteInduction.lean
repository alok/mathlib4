# Hyperfinite Induction

This file establishes the principle of hyperfinite induction for nonstandard analysis.

## Main results

* `hyperfiniteInduction` : Induction principle for standard hypernaturals
* `internalInduction` : Induction works internally up to any hyperfinite bound
* `overspill` : If a property holds for all standard naturals, it holds for some infinite hypernatural

/-! ## Comparison with Ordinal Induction -/

/-- Hyperfinite induction is analogous to ordinal induction but for internal sets.

Key differences:
- Ordinal induction works for all ordinals (external)
- Hyperfinite induction works up to any hyperfinite bound (internal)
- Both use well-foundedness, but hyperfinite uses internal well-foundedness

The crucial insight: Hyperfinite induction lets us "count down through the continuum"
because we're working internally within the nonstandard model.
