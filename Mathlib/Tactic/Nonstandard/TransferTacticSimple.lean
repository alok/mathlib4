# Transfer tactic for nonstandard analysis (simplified version)

This file implements a simplified transfer tactic for working with filter germs and hyperreals.
The tactic converts statements about germs to equivalent statements about the underlying types.

/-- Manual test of the simplified tactic -/
example (α ι : Type*) [Preorder α] (l : Ultrafilter ι) (a : α) : 
  (∀ x, a ≤ x) ↔ (∀ x : (l : Filter ι).Germ α, ↑a ≤ x) := by
  -- The ultrafilter coercion gives us a filter with NeBot
  have : (l : Filter ι).NeBot := inferInstance
  transfer_simple
  -- Now we should have: (∀ x, a ≤ x) ↔ (∀ x : Germ l α, liftPred (fun x => a ≤ x) x)
