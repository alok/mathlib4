# Compactness via Nonstandard Analysis

This file develops the NSA approach to compactness, showing how
the nonstandard characterization makes many proofs trivial.

## Main results

* `compact_iff_nsa` - Robinson's characterization of compactness
* `heine_borel_nsa` - [a,b] is compact (trivial proof!)
* `compact_implies_closed_nsa` - Compact subsets of Hausdorff spaces are closed
* `extreme_value_nsa` - Extreme value theorem with 5-line proof

  -- K is closed iff it contains all its limit points
  -- Equivalently: if x ∉ K, then x is not a limit point
