goal: convert https://github.com/ADedecker/nonstandard to lean 4. add it as a worktree.

use lean-explore to carefully find the right theorem names.

you can run it with `uv run --directory /Users/alokbeniwal/lean-explore leanexplore`

ultrathink a plan first

use lean-lsp-mcp to run every snippet for very fast feedback loops.

install mcp tools

use tasks to do each theorem/lemma separately by forking yourself into subagents.
